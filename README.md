## About <a name = "about"></a>

Dev free is a set of scripts to manage dependencies and packages of some programming languages without any kind of mobile data cost for Cuban programmers.

Dev free supports the installation of packages of the following programming languages:

- [Python](./python/)
    - [PIP](./python/pip-free.py)

In the near future, we will add scripts to support:

- NodeJS packages
- NuGet packages
- GO Packages
- R packages

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 


### Installing

Once the code is downloaded you need to install a set of dependencies to run some scripts. Go to the folder of the programming language you want and install the dependencies that are in the requirements.txt

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute new scripts, fix bugs, or add new sites to existing scripts. To contribute fork a repository and do a pull request.
